This will mean that there is no need to edit your .juliarc file and the Julia REPL will start a bit quicker since it does not have to parse and compile the package when it is loaded. The way to do this is described in the Julia manual but is also summarized here:Create a userimg.jl file that contains Base.require(:OhMyREPL).\nRun include(joinpath(JULIA_HOME, Base.DATAROOTDIR, \"julia\", \"build_sysimg.jl\"))\nRun build_sysimg(default_sysimg_path(), \"native\", USERIMGPATH; force=true) where USERIMGPATH is the path to the userimg.jl file.If you are building Julia from source, the userimg.jl file can just be moved to the Base folder and then run make like normal.Note that you will have to redo this process if OhMyREPL is updated."

To see what color each number represent there is the ANSICodes.test_ANSI_256() function.note: Note\nNot all terminals support the 256 color version, for example the default Windows command prompt does not. On Windows you can install for example mintty which has better color support. On other OS's consult Google for how to enable 256 color support for the terminal.If you want to convert between RGB hex codes and the 256 color codes the script at this link is quite useful.The keyword arguments bold, italics,  and underline are simply bools representing if the text should have that attribute.An ANSIToken can be show-ed which will print the ANSI code of it in the style that successive text will be printed in.(Image: )"

    "text": "We actually have a conflict now because both the syntax highlighter and the newly added pass will try to modify the properties of the printed Float64 token. This is where the prescedence of each pass come in. The order of each pass is executed from bottom up in the list given by OhMyREPL.show_passes(). As can be see above, the new pass has the highest prescedence which is why the color of Float64 is actually red.The prescedence of a pass can be modified with the OhMyREPL.prescedence!(pass::Union{String, Int}, prescedence::Int). The variable pass here is either the name of the pass or its number as given by OhMyREPL.show_passes(). We now set the prescedence of the new pass to 3:julia> OhMyREPL.prescedence!(\"Redify Float64\", 3)\n----------------------------------\n #   Pass name             Enabled  \n----------------------------------\n 1   BracketHighlighter    true     \n 2   SyntaxHighlighter     true     \n 3   Redify Float64        true     \n----------------------------------Rewriting the same string in the REPL as above we now get:(Image: )The foreground color of Float64 is now determined by the Syntax highlighter pass. Note that the syntax highlighter does not touch the underlining so that one is still kept from the new pass."
