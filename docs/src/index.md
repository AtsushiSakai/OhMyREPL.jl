# OhMyREPL

*This is my REPL. There are many like it, but this one is mine.*

A package that hooks into the Julia REPL and gives it syntax highlighting, bracket highlighting, [prompt paste mode](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/17599), [colorized, structured error messages](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/18228) and other goodies.

If you like this package please give it a star. I like stars.
